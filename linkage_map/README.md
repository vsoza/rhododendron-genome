# linkage_map
In order to establish a linkage map of the R. williamsianum genome, we generated 110 progeny from a genetic cross between the hybrid R. “Moonstone” (R. williamsianum x R. campylocarpum) and R. campylocarpum.
For the linkage analysis, we created single-end restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing libraries for the parents and progeny using PstI.
RAD sequencing data was processed and analyzed in Stacks v0.997 (Catchen et al. 2011, 2013) to call the genotypes for parents and progeny.
We used JoinMap v4.1 (van Ooijen 2006) to calculate linkage relationships and to define linkage groups of RAD markers.
Data files in linkage_map folder are loci used in JoinMap to create linkage map for R. williamsianum.
13 files represent the 13 chromosomes.
Each file contains locus ID from Stacks catalog, cM from JoinMap, and consensus sequence of the parents from Stacks at each locus.
